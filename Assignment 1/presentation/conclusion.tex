\section{Conclusion}
\begin{frame}{Conclusion and Outlook}
\begin{itemize}
\item Intel compiler is highly optimizing. Many idioms are detected and safely vectorized.
\item No manual loop fiddling. The compiler is very powerful and in the end might find a better solution than the manually optimized loop.
\item Care about data memory alignment. 16 Byte boundaries for SSE, 32 Byte boundaries for AVX.
\item Code readability goes first. Then find and optimize the real bottlenecks. \enquote{premature optimization is the root of all evil}.\footnote{Donald Knuth, \textit{Structured Programming with go to Statements}}
\item Use the tools: Compiler reports, dynamic profiler (Intel Advisor, Valgrind).
\end{itemize}
