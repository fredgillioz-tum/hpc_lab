\begin{frame}{Conclusion and Outlook}
\begin{itemize}
\item Intel compiler is highly optimizing. Many idioms are detected and safely vectorized.
\item No manual loop fiddling. The compiler is very powerful and in the end might find a better solution than the manually optimized loop.
\item Code readability goes first. Then find and optimize the real bottlenecks. \enquote{premature optimization is the root of all evil}.\footnote{Donald Knuth, \textit{Structured Programming with go to Statements}}
\item Make use of tools: Compiler reports, dynamic profiler (Intel Advisor)
\end{itemize}
